== Description ==


While there are plenty of really great methodologies and frameworks, like open brainstorming and the Creative Matrix, designed specifically for ideation, the BMC can also be a really powerful tool to get the creative (ideation) juices flowing. The key to using the BMC for ideation is that it’s best to start with your current business model. In other words, if you’re starting from zero, there are probably better methods for ideation.
